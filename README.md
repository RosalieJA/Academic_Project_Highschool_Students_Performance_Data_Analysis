Academic Project on data analysis in SY09 course (UTC)

Work realised by Rosalie Jardri, Matteo Scalabre and Matthieu Combelle, in June 2025. 
Programmation language : Python. 

This project is based on a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset/data). 
A project review was realized in LaTeX (see SY09_Revue_de_projet_Rendu_Final_COMBELLE_JARDRI_SCALABRE_12JUIN2025.pdf).

The code is segmented in 2 mains parts :
